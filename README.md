# A-Year-Of-Code

My plan is to: Code at-least an hour daily, and try to commit to github as much as I can.

My goals are to:

1- Open up to the digital world. (GOALS ARE DOWN FOR UPDATE AS I LEARN MORE)

2- Learn a variety of programming languages that cover different fields.

3- Take as many courses as I can.

4- Spend more time on Linux.

5- Record daily progress.
