# 100-Days-Of-Code

My plan is to:
1- Code at-least an hour daily.
2- Try to commit to github as much as I can.

My goals are to:
1- Open up to the digital world. (GOALS ARE DOWN FOR UPDATE AS I LEARN MORE)
2- Learn a variety of programming languages that cover different fields.
3- Take as many courses as I can.
4- Spend more time on Linux.
